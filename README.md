Thank you for visiting and wishing to check out my STARSORG code, all the info needed to understand the sections I contributed or partially contributed in are written as comments inside the vb and sql files (frmEvent, CEvent, CEvents, frmRSVP, CEvent_RSVP, CEvent_RSVPs, saveEvent.sql, saveRSVP.sql, etc). 
Through this I learned to hone in on my visual basic, how to work with a database implemented, and the importance of stored procedures. 
This is my first huge project with multiple members, and helped me realize how to overcome certain obstacles in this setting.
